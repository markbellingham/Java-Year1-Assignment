# Year1_Java_Assignment
First year programming assignment

This program is designed to calculate the frequency of letters in a given text. It will also calculate the frequency of word sizes.

To use this program you will need to have the Java JDK installed. There are three files in the src folder. Only the 'User Input' and 'Freq Calc' files are needed to run the program yourself. 'Tests' contains a separate Main which can be used for demonstration. In the root folder are some test files which were used to generate the results in the Test_Data.odt file.

To run the program, use the terminal to navigate to the directory where it is saved, type 'javac Bellingham_Mark_grp13_user_input.java' then type 'java Bellingham_Mark_grp13_user_input'. Then follow instruction on the screen.

The program is designed to handle errors in user input. Details of the types of errors which will be caught are in the Test_Data.odt file along with the expected output.
